## 🛡️ Guardrail 1: Enum Validation for Function Names

**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

### What It Does

Prevents AI from hallucinating function names that don't exist in the catalog.

### Implementation

```python
# Create enum of all valid function names
enum_names = sorted([f["function_name"] for f in function_descriptions])

schema = {
    "name": "StimulusFunctionMatches",
    "strict": True,
    "schema": {
        "properties": {
            "ranked": {
                "items": {
                    "properties": {
                        "name": {"type": "string", "enum": enum_names},  # ✓ Enum validation
                        ...
                    }
                }
            },
            "functions": {
                "type": "array",
                "items": {"type": "string", "enum": enum_names}  # ✓ Enum validation
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Benefits

- **Zero hallucinations** - AI can only return function names that actually exist
- **Type safety** - OpenAI's strict mode enforces the enum at API level
- **Guaranteed validity** - No need for post-validation filtering

## 🎯 Guardrail 2: Embedding-Based Shortlisting

**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** (Optional, enabled by default)

### What It Does

Pre-filters the catalog using semantic similarity before running detailed matching, improving both speed and accuracy.

### Implementation

```python
def search_by_image(
    self,
    image_input,
    use_shortlist: bool = True,      # ✓ Enable shortlisting
    shortlist_size: int = 30,        # ✓ Configurable size
    ...
):
    # Extract visual features
    visual_features = self.analyze_image(image_input)

    # Create search query from features
    search_terms = []
    search_terms.append(visual_features['visual_signature'])
    search_terms.extend(visual_features.get('families', []))
    search_terms.extend(visual_features.get('primitives', [])[:10])
    search_terms.extend(visual_features.get('patterns', []))
    search_query = " ".join(search_terms)

    # Use existing text search (GPT-3.5 powered) to shortlist
    shortlist_names = self.search_functions(search_query, max_results=shortlist_size)

    # Filter catalog to shortlisted functions only
    function_descriptions = [
        f for f in all_function_descriptions
        if f["function_name"] in shortlist_names
    ]
```

### Benefits

- **Faster** - Only 20-30 functions sent to detailed matcher instead of all 121
- **More accurate** - Focus on semantically relevant candidates
- **Cost effective** - Smaller context = fewer tokens = lower API costs
- **Flexible** - Can disable for exhaustive search if needed

### Configuration

```python
# Default: Shortlist enabled with 30 candidates
results = engine.search_by_image(image)

# Disable shortlisting (search all functions)
results = engine.search_by_image(image, use_shortlist=False)

# Custom shortlist size
results = engine.search_by_image(image, shortlist_size=50)
```

## 🔒 Guardrail 3: Mutual-Exclusion Rules

**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

### What It Does

Applies penalty scoring when visual features and function types are contradictory.

### Implementation (in MATCH_PROMPT)

```
Mutual-exclusion penalties (apply all that fit):
   -5 if families are contradictory (e.g., FRACTION_MODEL vs NUMBER_LINE;
      BAR_CHART vs COORDINATE_PLANE unless chart-on-axes is explicit)
   -4 if function relies on 3D solids but features suggest strictly 2D geometry or charts
   -3 if function is a TABLE but features show a plotted/diagrammatic visualization
   -2 if function is a generic GRID but a more specific family is evident from features
```

### Examples

| User Image Features             | Wrong Function Type | Penalty | Reasoning              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------- | ---------------------- |
| PLACE_VALUE_MODEL + GRID_MxN    | fraction_models     | -5      | Contradictory families |
| GEOMETRY_2D + POLYGON           | draw_3d_prisms      | -4      | 2D vs 3D mismatch      |
| COORDINATE_PLANE + AXES_LABELED | draw_table          | -3      | Plotted vs tabular     |
| PLACE_VALUE_MODEL + flats/rods  | draw_grid_generic   | -2      | Specific beats generic |

### Benefits

- **Prevents false positives** - Base-ten images won't match fraction functions
- **Self-documenting** - Rules are generic and extensible
- **No code changes needed** - Add new rules directly in the prompt

## 🎲 Guardrail 4: Determinism

**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

### What It Does

Ensures identical inputs produce identical outputs for reproducibility and testing.

### Implementation

```python
response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    temperature=0,        # ✓ Zero randomness
    seed=42,              # ✓ Deterministic seed
    response_format={"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": schema},
    ...
)
```

### Benefits

- **Reproducible** - Same image → same results every time
- **Testable** - Can write reliable integration tests
- **Debuggable** - Consistent behavior aids troubleshooting
- **Auditable** - Results can be verified and compared

### Testing

```python
# Run twice with same image
result1 = engine.search_by_image(test_image)
result2 = engine.search_by_image(test_image)

assert result1 == result2  # ✓ Always passes with seed=42
```

## 🔌 Plug Points

### 1. Visual Feature Extraction (ANALYZE_IMAGE_PROMPT)

**Status:** ✅ **REPLACED**

```python
def analyze_image(self, image_input) -> Dict:
    """Extract structured visual features using OpenAI Vision API."""
    # Returns: {
    #     "visual_signature": str,
    #     "families": List[str],      # PLACE_VALUE_MODEL, NUMBER_LINE, etc.
    #     "primitives": List[str],    # CUBE, RECTANGLE, AXIS_X, etc.
    #     "patterns": List[str],      # GRID_MxN, PARTITION_EQUAL, etc.
    #     "counts": Dict[str, int],   # bars, sectors, grid_rows, etc.
    #     "detected_text": List[str]  # Any visible text
    # }
```

### 2. Feature → Catalog Matching (MATCH_PROMPT)

**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

```python
# Features from step 1 fed directly into matcher
features_json = json.dumps(visual_features, indent=2)
functions_json = json.dumps(function_descriptions, indent=2)

user_instructions = f"""Input:
- features (from vision): {features_json}
- function catalog (JSON list): {functions_json}

Goal: rank the most relevant functions using general visual evidence...
[Full MATCH_PROMPT with scoring rules]
"""
```

### 3. Catalog Structure Hints

**Status:** ✅ **UTILIZED**

The catalog already includes structured hints that the matcher uses:

```json
{
  "function_name": "draw_base_ten_blocks",
  "description": "3D visualization of base ten blocks for place value",
  "category": "arithmetic",
  "tags": [
    "base_ten_blocks",
    "3D_visualization",
    "place_value",
    "arithmetic"
  ],
  "parameters": {...},
  "images": [...]
}
```

The matcher mines these fields for:

- **Name matching** (`function_name`)
- **Tag matching** (`tags` - acts as primary/secondary families)
- **Description matching** (`description`)
- **Category matching** (`category`)
- **Parameter hints** (`parameters` - mentions ticks, axes, etc.)

### Enhancement Opportunity

For even better matching, could add explicit family fields:

```json
{
  "function_name": "draw_base_ten_blocks",
  "primary_family": "PLACE_VALUE_MODEL",
  "secondary_families": ["GEOMETRY_3D", "GRID_GENERIC"],
  ...
}
```

But current system works well by mining tags/description!
