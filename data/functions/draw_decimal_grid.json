    "description": "The images generated by this function show grids that represent decimal numbers. Each grid is divided into either 10 or 100 parts, depending on the 'division' parameter. The number of shaded squares in each grid represents a decimal number. For example, if the division is 10 and there are 3 shaded squares, it represents the decimal 0.3. If the division is 100 and there are 45 shaded squares, it represents the decimal 0.45. This visual representation helps students understand the concept of decimals and how they relate to fractions. It also helps students understand the concept of division as splitting a whole into equal parts.",

    "educational_purpose": "The main educational purpose of this function is to help students understand the concept of decimals and fractions. By visualizing these concepts as shaded squares in a grid, students can more easily grasp the idea that a decimal or fraction represents a part of a whole. This can also aid in understanding division as splitting a whole into equal parts. Furthermore, the random color selection for the shaded squares can make the learning process more engaging and visually appealing for students."
