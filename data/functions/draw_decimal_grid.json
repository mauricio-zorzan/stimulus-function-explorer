  "function_name": "draw_decimal_grid",
  "description": "The function 'draw_decimal_grid' generates a visual representation of decimal numbers using a grid system. It creates grids divided into either 10 or 100 equal parts, with a certain number of parts shaded to represent a decimal or fraction. The grids are used for educational purposes, particularly for teaching decimal representation and fraction-to-decimal conversion.",

    "description": "The 'draw_decimal_grid' function can generate images of decimal grids, which are grids divided into either 10 or 100 equal parts. The grids are shaded to represent a particular decimal or fraction. The function accepts two inputs: 'division', which determines how many parts the grid is divided into, and 'shaded_squares', which specifies the number of squares to shade. The function can create multiple grids if the number of shaded squares exceeds the division value, up to a maximum of 10 fully shaded grids. These visualizations are useful for teaching decimal representation and fraction-to-decimal conversion.",
