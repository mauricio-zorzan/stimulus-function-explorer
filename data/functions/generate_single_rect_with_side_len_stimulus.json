    "description": "The function generates a visualization of a single rectangle with labeled side lengths. It accepts a list of rectangular grid data as input, but requires exactly one rectangle. The rectangle's length, width, and unit are used to draw and label the rectangle. The aspect ratio of the rectangle is calculated and capped at 5:1 to prevent extreme distortions. The rectangle is then scaled to fit within a fixed area while maintaining the capped aspect ratio, and centered in the figure. This function is useful for teaching students about the properties of rectangles and the concept of aspect ratio.",
