    "description": "The function 'draw_parallel_lines_cut_by_transversal' creates a visualization of two parallel lines cut by a transversal line. It accepts an input of type 'ParallelLinesTransversal' which includes the angle between the transversal and the parallel lines, and labels for the angles formed at the intersection points. The function ensures a minimum line length of 3 units and adjusts the length of the transversal line based on the provided angle. This visualization can be used in teaching geometry, specifically in understanding the properties of parallel lines and transversal lines, and the angles they form.",
