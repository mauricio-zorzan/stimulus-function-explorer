    "description": "The draw_lines_of_best_fit function can generate scatter plots with multiple lines of best fit, each with a unique color. The function accepts a LinesOfBestFit object, which contains a list of Line objects. Each Line object includes a slope, y-intercept, and label. The function plots each line on the same scatter plot, creating a visual representation of multiple lines of best fit. This function is particularly useful in teaching linear regression, correlation, and data analysis. It helps students understand how different lines can fit the same set of data points and how changes in slope and y-intercept affect the line's fit.",
