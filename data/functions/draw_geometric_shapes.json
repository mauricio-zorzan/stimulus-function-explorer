    "description": "The images generated by the draw_geometric_shapes function cover a wide range of geometric concepts. They include basic shapes such as circles and polygons, as well as more complex diagrams like Venn diagrams and grids. These images can be used to illustrate concepts such as area, perimeter, and angles, as well as relationships between different shapes. The function also includes options for rotating shapes and adding labels, which can be used to further enhance understanding of geometric concepts.",

    "educational_purpose": "The draw_geometric_shapes function serves as a powerful tool for teaching geometry. By providing visual representations of geometric concepts, it helps students to better understand these concepts and see how they are applied in practice. The ability to manipulate shapes and diagrams, such as by rotating them or adding labels, further enhances this understanding by allowing students to explore these concepts in a hands-on way. This can lead to deeper comprehension and improved retention of geometric concepts."
