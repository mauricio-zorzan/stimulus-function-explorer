It accepts inputs of length, width, and units for the rectangle. The function scales the rectangle to fit well in the figure, with a target maximum dimension of 8 units. The educational purpose of this function is to help students understand the concept of area in geometry, and how it is calculated from the dimensions of a shape. It can be used in lessons on geometry, area calculation, and understanding dimensions.",
