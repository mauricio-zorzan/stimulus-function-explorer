    "description": "The 'create_clock' function can generate two types of visualizations: analog clocks and digital clocks. It accepts inputs based on the 'Clock' stimulus description class, which specifies the type of clock ('analog' or 'digital') and the time to be displayed (in hours and minutes). The function is designed to create visual aids for teaching time-telling skills, making it a valuable tool for early mathematics education. The generated clocks can be used in various educational scenarios, such as quizzes, worksheets, or interactive learning modules.",
