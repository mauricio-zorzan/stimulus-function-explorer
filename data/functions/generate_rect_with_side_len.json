The function accepts a list of rectangle objects, each with a length and width. The function scales each rectangle's dimensions to the target area, while maintaining the original aspect ratio. The rectangles are then plotted on a grid, with each rectangle's dimensions labeled. The function is designed to help students visualize and understand the concepts of area, scale, and proportion.
