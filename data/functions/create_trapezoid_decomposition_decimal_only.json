    "description": "This function can draw a trapezoid with vertices defined by the user. The trapezoid is filled with a color chosen randomly from a pastel palette. The lengths of the top and bottom bases are labeled with decimal values. The function accepts inputs in the form of a TrapezoidDecomposition object, which includes vertices, units, and mode. The vertices define the shape of the trapezoid, the units define the measurement unit, and the mode can be used to hide the label of the bottom base, prompting students to compute it. This visualization can be used in various educational scenarios, such as teaching geometry, understanding the concept of area, or practicing decimal arithmetic.",
