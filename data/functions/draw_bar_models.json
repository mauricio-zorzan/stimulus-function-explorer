    "description": "The images generated by this function show bar models, which are visual representations of mathematical concepts such as fractions and ratios. Each bar is divided into sections, with each section representing a part of the whole. The size of each section corresponds to the value it represents, and different colors are used to distinguish between different sections or categories. Unknown values are represented by a question mark and highlighted in green. This visual representation helps students understand the concept of fractions and ratios in a more intuitive way, as they can see the relative sizes of the different parts. The function can generate two types of bar models: single bar models and comparison bar models. Single bar models represent a single whole divided into parts, while comparison bar models represent two or more wholes for comparison purposes.",

    "educational_purpose": "Bar models are a powerful tool for teaching students about fractions and ratios. By visualizing these concepts, students can develop a more intuitive understanding of them. They can see how a whole is divided into parts, and how the size of each part corresponds to its value. This can help them understand the concept of a fraction or ratio as a part of a whole. Furthermore, the use of different colors to distinguish between different sections or categories can help students understand the concept of categorization. The highlighting of unknown values in green can help students understand the concept of an unknown in a mathematical equation, and can prompt them to solve for the unknown."
