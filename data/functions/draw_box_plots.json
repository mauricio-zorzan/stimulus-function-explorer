The function accepts input of type 'BoxPlotData', which includes minimum value, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and maximum value of a data set. It can generate single or multiple box plots, each with a unique color for better differentiation. The function validates that each successive value in the 'BoxPlotData' is larger than the previous one, ensuring the data is correctly ordered for a box plot.
