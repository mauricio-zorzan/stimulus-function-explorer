    "description": "The images generated by this function are box plots, which are a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on a five number summary ('minimum', first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and 'maximum'). These plots can provide detailed insights about the data including its symmetry, skewness, and outliers if any. The colors of the box plots are randomly selected from a predefined color palette, providing a visually appealing and distinct representation for each box plot.",

          "The line inside the box represents the median of the data.",
          "The 'whiskers' extending from the box indicate variability outside the upper and lower quartiles, hence they are also a measure of statistical dispersion. The position of the whiskers is set by default to 1.5*IQR from the edges of the box.",

    "educational_purpose": "Box plots are a great way to visualize the distribution of data, and they can be very useful in the classroom for teaching students about statistics. They provide a visual representation of the data's quartiles, median, and potential outliers. This can help students better understand these concepts and how they relate to data distribution. Additionally, by comparing box plots, students can make comparisons between different data sets in a meaningful way."
