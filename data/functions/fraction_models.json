  "description": "The function 'draw_fractional_models_multiplication_units' is designed to create a visual representation of the multiplication of fractions. It takes two fractions as input and generates a rectangular grid. The dimensions of the grid are determined by the denominators of the fractions, and the shaded area represents the product of the fractions. The grid is divided into smaller rectangles, each representing a unit fraction. The function uses the matplotlib library to create the visualization.",
