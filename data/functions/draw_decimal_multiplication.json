    "description": "The draw_decimal_multiplication function generates grid-based visualizations of decimal multiplication. It accepts two decimal factors as input, represented as 0.a and 0.b or 0.a and 1.b. The function then creates a grid (or two grids) where the second factor is represented by shading columns and the first factor is represented by adding diagonal lines to rows of the shaded area. The function is designed to help students understand the process of decimal multiplication by visualizing the factors and their product on a grid. The function can be used in a variety of educational settings, from classroom instruction to self-study and homework assignments.",
