These models are a visual representation of mathematical operations, particularly multiplication and division, as well as fractions and decimals. The tables are dynamically sized based on the input data, with the number of rows and columns corresponding to the dimensions of the area model. The cell content represents the data points of the model, and the headers provide context for the rows and columns.
