It accepts a MultiGraphList as input, which should contain exactly four CategoricalGraph objects. Each CategoricalGraph object includes the data (category and frequency), title, and picture configuration (star value, star unit, and show half star value). The function validates the input data, ensuring that there are exactly four sets of data.
