    "description": "The 'create_multi_bar_graph' function can draw a 2x2 grid of bar graphs, each representing a different set of categorical data. It accepts a MultiGraphList containing exactly 4 CategoricalGraph objects as input. Each CategoricalGraph object should contain a list of categories and their corresponding frequencies, a title, and labels for the x and y axes. The function is designed to facilitate comparison and analysis of different data sets, making it a useful tool for teaching data visualization and analysis in an educational setting. It is important to note that the function requires exactly 4 sets of data, and will raise a ValueError if this condition is not met.",
