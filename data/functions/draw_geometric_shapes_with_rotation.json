    "description": "The function 'draw_geometric_shapes_with_rotation' can draw a variety of geometric shapes including rectangles, rhombuses, parallelograms, circles, and regular quadrilaterals. It accepts a list of geometric shapes with their respective properties such as color and label, and rotation value. The function is designed to handle a varying number of shapes, adjusting the size and layout of the shapes based on the total number. It also maintains the aspect ratio of the shapes, ensuring that the shapes are not distorted during rotation. This function is particularly useful in teaching geometry, where students can visually understand the properties of different shapes and the effects of rotation.",
