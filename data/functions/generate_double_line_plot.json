    "description": "The function 'generate_double_line_plot' can draw a double line plot, a type of graph that shows two sets of data points on the same x-axis. The input to this function is a 'DoubleLinePlot' object, which contains information about the x-axis label, the range of the x-axis, and two datasets. Each dataset contains a title and a list of data points, with each data point having a value and a frequency. The function has constraints on the frequency of data points, which should be between 0 and 8. This function is useful in teaching students about data visualization, comparison of datasets, and understanding frequency distributions.",
