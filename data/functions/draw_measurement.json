    "description": "The 'draw_measurement' function can create two types of visualizations: a cup filled with liquid to represent volume measurements, and an analog scale to represent weight measurements. The function accepts inputs based on the 'Measurements' class, which includes the measurement value, units (milliliters, liters, grams, kilograms), and color for the liquid or weight. The function validates the units and converts them if necessary, and it calculates the dimensions and scale parameters for the visualization. These images can be used in educational settings to teach students about different units of measurement and how to convert between them.",
