    "description": "This function can draw a variety of geometric shapes without side length indicators. It accepts a list of geometric shapes as input, each of which includes a label and a color. The function adjusts the size and layout of the shapes based on the number of shapes to be drawn. It can draw shapes in a single row layout, with the size per shape adjusted based on the number of shapes. The function includes a random rotation for parallelograms. This function is useful for teaching students about the properties of different geometric shapes, without the distraction of side length indicators.",
