  "function_name": "draw_division_model",
  "description": "The function 'draw_division_model' generates a visual representation of a division operation using fraction bar models. It can illustrate both whole numbers and fractions, providing an intuitive understanding of division as partitioning or sharing. This function is particularly useful in teaching the concept of fractions and division to students in a visually engaging manner.",

    "description": "The 'draw_division_model' function can create visualizations of division operations using fraction bar models. It accepts a Pydantic model as input, which contains the dividend and divisor information. The dividend and divisor can be either whole numbers or fractions. The function dynamically calculates the size of the matplotlib figure based on the input. The function has been designed to aid in teaching and learning of division and fractions, making it easier for students to grasp these concepts through visual aids.",
