    "title": "Available Images: Geometric Shapes with Angles",
    "description": "The function can draw several types of geometric shapes including rectangles, squares, right triangles, obtuse triangles, acute triangles, isosceles triangles, and trapezoids. Each shape is drawn with specified angle markings, which are represented as arcs for acute and obtuse angles, and squares for right angles. The function accepts a list of geometric shapes with their corresponding angles as input. The number of shapes drawn is determined by the length of the input list. The function has a constraint on the total width of the images, which is capped at a reasonable maximum to ensure the images are clear and easy to understand. This function is particularly useful in teaching and learning geometry, as it allows students to visualize different geometric shapes and their corresponding angles.",
