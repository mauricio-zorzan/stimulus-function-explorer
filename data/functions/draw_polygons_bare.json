    "description": "The 'draw_polygons_bare' function can draw a variety of polygons based on the input parameters. It accepts a list of polygons, each defined by either its number of sides, side lengths, and angles, or just the number of sides for regular polygons. The function then generates a plot for each polygon in the list, with the polygons drawn in the specified colors. This function is particularly useful in teaching and learning geometry, as it allows for the visualization of different types of polygons and their properties.",
