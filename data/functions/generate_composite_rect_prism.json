  "function_name": "generate_composite_rect_prism",
  "description": "The function 'generate_composite_rect_prism' generates a 3D visualization of one or more rectangular prisms, stacked on top of each other. The prisms can have different dimensions, and the function allows for the hiding of measurements. This can be used for educational purposes, such as teaching geometry, volume, and spatial reasoning.",

    "description": "The function 'generate_composite_rect_prism' can draw 3D visualizations of composite rectangular prisms. It accepts a list of tuples, each representing the dimensions of a prism (height, width, length), a unit of measurement, and a boolean value to hide or show measurements. The function stacks the prisms on top of each other in the order they are provided. The function is designed to help students understand the concept of volume and spatial reasoning. It can be used in a variety of educational settings, from elementary to high school, for teaching geometry and measurement.",
