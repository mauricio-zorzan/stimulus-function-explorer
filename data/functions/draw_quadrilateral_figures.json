It accepts a list of shape types, side labels for each shape, and a boolean value to show or hide tick marks. The shapes can be rotated randomly or in standard orientation, and each shape is drawn in a random color. This function is useful in teaching geometry, specifically the properties and differences between various types of quadrilaterals.",
