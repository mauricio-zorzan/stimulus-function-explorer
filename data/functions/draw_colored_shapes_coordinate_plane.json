The inputs it accepts are based on the stimulus description class, which includes details about each shape such as its color, label, and coordinates. The function validates that all shape coordinates are within the first quadrant (0-10 range) and that no two shapes share the same coordinates. The educational purpose of this function is to help students learn about coordinates and shape identification on a coordinate plane. It can be used in a variety of geometry and algebra lessons.",
