    "description": "The function 'create_fixed_step_number_line' can draw a number line with specified range, step size, and minor divisions. It accepts inputs based on the stimulus description class 'FixedStepNumberLine', which includes the range of the number line, the step size for major ticks, and the number of minor divisions between major ticks. The function ensures that the number line includes a buffer of 10% of the total range on both ends. The educational purpose of this function is to provide a visual representation of number lines, which can be used to teach concepts such as intervals, fractions, and divisions.",
