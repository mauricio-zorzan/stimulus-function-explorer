    "description": "The 'plot_nonlinear' function can generate 2D plots of four types of nonlinear equations: quadratic, cubic, quartic, and quintic. It accepts a 'NonlinearGraph' object as input, which specifies the type of equation and its coefficients. The function creates a range of x values from -10 to 10 and calculates the corresponding y values based on the specified equation. The plot is then saved as an image file. This function is useful in educational settings where students are learning about the properties and behaviors of different types of nonlinear equations.",
