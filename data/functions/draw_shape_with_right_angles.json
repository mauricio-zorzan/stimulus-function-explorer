    "description": "The function 'draw_shape_with_right_angles' can draw a wide variety of shapes based on the number of interior right angles specified. It accepts an input of a ShapeWithRightAngles object, which contains the number of right angles desired. The function then generates a shape that fits the criteria, with the shape being randomly rotated for added variety. The shapes supported include circles, equilateral triangles, pentagons, hexagons, quadrilaterals, right triangles, kites, trapezoids, file icon shapes, rectangles, and squares. This function serves as a valuable tool for teaching the concept of right angles in geometry.",
