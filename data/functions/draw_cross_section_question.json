The cross-sections can be either horizontal or vertical, depending on the shape and the desired cross-section. The function accepts a 'CrossSectionQuestion' object as input, which contains the shape and the correct cross-section. The shape is defined by its type and dimensions (e.g., radius for a sphere, height and base for a cone). The function validates the input and determines the orientation of the cross-section based on a predefined map of valid combinations.
