    "description": "The function can draw multiple 3D rectangular prisms, each with a specified base area and height. It accepts a list of 'BaseAreaRectangularPrism' objects, each of which includes the base area and height of a prism. The function calculates the maximum dimensions across all prisms to ensure consistent scaling and visualization. The resulting grid of prisms aids in understanding geometric concepts and comparisons. The function is particularly useful in educational settings where visual aids can enhance comprehension of abstract mathematical concepts.",
