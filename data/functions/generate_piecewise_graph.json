  "function_name": "generate_piecewise_graph",
  "description": "The 'generate_piecewise_graph' function is designed to create piecewise graphs, which are graphs defined by multiple sub-functions, each applying to a certain interval of the independent variable. The function is intended for educational purposes, allowing students to visualize complex mathematical concepts in a simple, intuitive manner.",

    "description": "The 'generate_piecewise_graph' function can draw piecewise graphs, which are defined by multiple sub-functions. Each sub-function corresponds to a segment in the graph. The function accepts a 'GraphingPiecewise' object as input, which contains information about the segments of the graph, as well as optional labels for the x and y axes. The graph can contain both linear and non-linear segments, with the curve direction for non-linear segments being randomly chosen. The educational purpose of this function is to help students understand the concept of piecewise functions, and how different functions can apply to different intervals of the same variable.",
