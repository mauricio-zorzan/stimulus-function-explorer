    "description": "The images generated by this function show a rectangular array of items, with each item represented by a colored circle. The number of rows and columns in the array can be adjusted to represent different multiplication and division problems. For example, an array with 3 rows and 4 columns can represent the multiplication problem 3x4=12 or the division problem 12\u00f73=4. By visualizing these problems in this way, students can gain a deeper understanding of these fundamental arithmetic operations.",

    "educational_purpose": "The main educational purpose of this function is to provide a visual aid for understanding multiplication and division. By seeing the items arranged in a rectangular array, students can more easily grasp the concept of multiplication as repeated addition (i.e., adding the same number multiple times) and division as partitioning (i.e., dividing a set of items into equal parts). This can help to build a strong foundation for more advanced mathematical concepts."
