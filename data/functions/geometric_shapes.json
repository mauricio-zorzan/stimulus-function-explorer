  "description": "The 'geometric_shapes' function is designed to generate a variety of geometric shapes with rotation support. It utilizes several libraries such as matplotlib and numpy to create and manipulate these shapes. The function can generate a wide range of geometric shapes including circles, polygons, quadrilaterals, and prisms. It also supports complex figures and composite shapes. The function is designed to be highly customizable, allowing for the creation of unique and varied geometric visualizations. The function is primarily used for educational purposes, helping students visualize and understand complex geometric concepts.",
