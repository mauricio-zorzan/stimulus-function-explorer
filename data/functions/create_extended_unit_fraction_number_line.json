  "description": "This function generates a number line visualization that extends beyond the unit fraction. It is designed to aid in the understanding of fractions and their placement on a number line. The function only labels 0 and the fraction endpoint, with minor divisions for counting, which helps students to visualize and understand the concept of fractions.",

    "description": "The function creates a number line that extends beyond the unit fraction. It takes as input an instance of the ExtendedUnitFractionNumberLine class, which includes parameters such as the range of the number line, the number of minor divisions, whether to show all tick labels, and the labeled fraction. The function is constrained by the range of the number line, which should start at 0 and end at the fraction value. It is designed to aid in the teaching and learning of fractions, particularly in understanding their placement on a number line.",
