It accepts a list of objects, each with a specified length, a label, and an optional unit of measurement. The function then generates a visual representation of these objects, with their lengths represented proportionally. The objects can be displayed with or without a unit of measurement, and the function can handle up to three objects at a time. This function is particularly useful in teaching students about measurement and comparison, as it allows them to visually compare the lengths of different objects.",
