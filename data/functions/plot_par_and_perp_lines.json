It accepts a list of line objects as input, each of which includes a label (a string of exactly two uppercase letters), a slope, and a y-intercept. The function validates the label of each line, ensuring that it consists of exactly two uppercase letters. The lines are drawn within a range of x values from -6 to 6. This function is particularly useful for visualizing the concepts of parallel and perpendicular lines in geometry, as it allows for the clear comparison of different lines' slopes and positions.",
