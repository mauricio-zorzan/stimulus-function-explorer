    "description": "The 'draw_circle_with_arcs' function is capable of generating a variety of images depicting a circle with intersecting lines that form arcs. The function accepts a CircleWithArcsDescription object as input, which contains parameters such as arc size and point labels. The arc size determines the size of the arcs formed by the intersecting lines, while the point labels provide labels for the points at the arc endpoints. The function has a constraint on the arc size, which must be a positive integer less than or equal to 360. The function is primarily used in educational settings to help students visualize and understand geometric concepts related to circles and arcs.",
