It accepts a 'MultipleGrids' object as input, which contains a list of 'Grid' objects and an 'irregularity' setting. Each 'Grid' object specifies the length and width of the grid. The 'irregularity' setting determines whether the grids are regular, irregular, or a mix of both. The function can draw up to 5 grids, each with different dimensions.
