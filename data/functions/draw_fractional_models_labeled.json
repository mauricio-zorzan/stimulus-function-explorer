  "function_name": "draw_fractional_models_labeled",
  "description": "The function 'draw_fractional_models_labeled' generates visual representations of fractions in the form of either rectangles or circles. Each fraction is represented as a shape divided into segments, with the fraction's numerator determining the number of filled segments. This visualization aids in understanding the concept of fractions and their representation.",

    "description": "The function can draw two types of visualizations: rectangles and circles, each representing a fraction. The input it accepts is a list of dictionaries, each containing a shape (rectangle or circle) and a fraction in the form of a string (e.g., '1/2'). The function generates a random color for each fraction's filled segments, ensuring that the color is neither too dark nor too light. The educational purpose of this function is to provide a visual understanding of fractions, which can be particularly useful in teaching environments.",
