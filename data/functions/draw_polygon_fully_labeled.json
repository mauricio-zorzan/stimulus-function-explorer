  "description": "The 'draw_polygon_fully_labeled' function generates educational stimulus images of various types of polygons with all sides labeled with their measurements. The function is designed to help students understand the concept of perimeter, especially when all dimensions are provided. It supports a range of polygon types from squares and rectangles to regular polygons with 3-10 sides, and L-shaped and T-shaped polygons.",

Each polygon is fully labeled with the measurements of all sides. The function accepts inputs of side lengths, units, and the type of shape to be drawn. The side lengths must be positive integers, and the function supports 3-10 sides. The shape type can be 'square', 'rectangle', 'regular', 'L-shape', or 'T-shape'.
