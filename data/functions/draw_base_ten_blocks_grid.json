    "description": "The draw_base_ten_blocks_grid function generates a grid of base ten blocks, which can be used to visually represent any number from 1 to 600. The function accepts an instance of the BaseTenBlockGridStimulus class as input, which specifies the number of blocks and their value. The function is constrained to a maximum of 6 blocks, arranged in a grid of 2 columns and 3 rows. This visualization is particularly useful in teaching concepts of place value and number composition in elementary mathematics.",
