    "description": "The images generated by this function represent numbers using base ten blocks, which are a set of manipulatives used to teach arithmetic at the elementary school level. Each block represents a different order of magnitude: ones, tens, and hundreds. The blocks are drawn in a grid, with the size and position of each block corresponding to its value. The images are color-coded for easy differentiation between different orders of magnitude. This visual representation helps students understand the concept of place value and how different orders of magnitude contribute to the overall value of a number. It also provides a visual aid for performing arithmetic operations, such as addition and subtraction, by manipulating the blocks.",

    "educational_purpose": "The primary educational purpose of this function is to provide a visual aid for teaching arithmetic and the concept of place value. By representing numbers as collections of base ten blocks, it helps students understand how different orders of magnitude contribute to the overall value of a number. This can make it easier for students to grasp the concept of place value, which is fundamental to understanding arithmetic operations. Additionally, by providing a visual representation of arithmetic operations, it can help students understand these operations in a more intuitive way, making it easier for them to learn and apply these concepts."
