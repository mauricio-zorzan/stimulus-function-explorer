  "description": "The 'clocks' function is designed to create a visual representation of an analog clock. It uses the matplotlib library to draw a circle representing the clock face, tick marks for hours and minutes, and hands for hours and minutes. The function uses mathematical concepts such as angles and radii to position the elements of the clock correctly. The educational purpose of this function is to help students understand the concept of time, the structure of an analog clock, and the mathematical principles behind it, such as angles and circular geometry.",
