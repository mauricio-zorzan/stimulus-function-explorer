    "description": "This function can draw both regular and irregular polygons based on the input parameters. It accepts a list of polygons, each defined by its number of sides, side lengths, and angles. Additionally, it can be specified whether to show side lengths, angle markings, and tick marks. The function is constrained by the number of polygons that can be displayed at once, and the side lengths and angles must be valid for a polygon of the given number of sides. This function serves as an educational tool for teaching and visualizing the properties of regular and irregular polygons.",
