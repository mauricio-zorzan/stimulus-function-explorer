    "description": "The function 'draw_labeled_transversal_angle' generates diagrams of two parallel lines intersected by a transversal, creating eight angles. It accepts an instance of TransversalAngleParams as input, which includes the given angle and the positions for the given angle and the variable angle 'x'. The function validates the positions to ensure they are within the range of 1 to 8, corresponding to the eight possible positions around the transversal. These diagrams are used in geometry lessons to illustrate the properties of transversal angles, such as corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and alternate exterior angles.",
