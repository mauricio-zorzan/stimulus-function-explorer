    "description": "This function can draw a composite shape that is a union of two rectangles and one triangle. It accepts inputs based on the CompositeRectangularTriangularGrid class, which includes the dimensions and positions of the rectangles and triangle. The function then merges these shapes into one continuous shape, labels the outer edges with lengths, and fills the shape. This visualization is useful in teaching geometry, particularly the concepts of area and perimeter. It can also be used to illustrate the principle of superposition in geometry.",
