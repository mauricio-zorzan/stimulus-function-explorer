    "title": "Available Images: Division as Equal Grouping",
    "description": "The images generated by this function visually represent the concept of division as equal grouping. Each image contains a specified number of groups, each with the same number of dots. The groups are represented as large circles, and the dots as smaller circles within the larger ones. These images help students understand that division involves splitting a quantity into equal parts. The number of groups and the number of dots per group are customizable, allowing educators to tailor the difficulty level to the needs of their students.",

    "educational_purpose": "The visualization aids in solidifying the concept of division as equal grouping. By seeing the groups and the dots within them, students can understand how a total quantity can be divided into equal parts. This is particularly useful for students who are visual learners. Furthermore, the ability to customize the number of groups and dots allows educators to progressively increase the complexity as students become more comfortable with the concept."
