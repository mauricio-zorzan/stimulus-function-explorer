  "description": "The function 'draw_divide_into_equal_groups' creates a visual representation of a given number of dots divided into equal groups. Each group is represented by a large circle, and the number of dots in each group is represented by smaller circles within the large circle. This visualization is useful for teaching concepts related to division and grouping in mathematics.",

The number of dots per group and the number of groups are both constrained to be between 1 and 10 inclusive. This visualization can be used to teach and reinforce understanding of division, grouping, and the concept of equal distribution in an intuitive and visual manner.",
