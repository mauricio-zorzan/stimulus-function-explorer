    "description": "This function can draw a variety of geometric shapes, including rectangles, rhombuses, parallelograms, circles, and regular quadrilaterals. It accepts a list of geometric shapes with rotation as input, each item in the list specifying the type of shape, its color, and its label. The function adjusts the size and layout of the shapes based on the number of shapes to be drawn. The primary educational purpose of this function is to help students learn to recognize shapes regardless of their orientation, a key skill in geometry.",
