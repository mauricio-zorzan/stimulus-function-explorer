These tables can be either vertical or horizontal, depending on the input data. The tables are generated using the matplotlib library and are saved as image files. The purpose of these images is to provide a clear and concise way to represent and analyze data. They can be used in a variety of educational settings, from teaching basic data representation in middle school to more advanced data analysis in college.",

By seeing data organized in a table format, students can more easily understand and analyze the data. This can help in teaching a variety of mathematical concepts, including data representation, data analysis, and statistics. Furthermore, by generating the tables as images, the function allows for easy integration of the tables into a variety of educational materials, such as worksheets, presentations, and online learning platforms."
