    "description": "This function can draw one or more extended unit fraction number lines, each with a range that extends from zero to a specified fraction value. It accepts a list of number line descriptions, each of which includes a range with minimum and maximum values. The function ensures that the minimum value is greater than or equal to zero and the maximum value is the fraction to be represented. The number lines are drawn with a buffer of 10% of the total range on either side for clarity. This visualization tool can be used in a variety of educational contexts, from introducing the concept of fractions to exploring equivalent fractions and fraction operations.",
