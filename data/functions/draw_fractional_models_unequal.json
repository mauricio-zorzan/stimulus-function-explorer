  "function_name": "draw_fractional_models_unequal",
  "description": "The 'draw_fractional_models_unequal' function generates images of shapes, specifically rectangles, divided into segments that represent fractions. The segments may be equally or unequally divided, and each shape is fully shaded with a randomly generated color. This function is designed to aid in the teaching and understanding of fractions, particularly the concept of equal and unequal parts.",

    "description": "The 'draw_fractional_models_unequal' function can generate images of rectangles divided into segments, with each segment representing a fraction of the whole. The function accepts a list of dictionaries as input, with each dictionary containing the shape, number of divided parts, and whether the shape is equally divided. The function ensures that the generated colors are neither too dark nor too light by constraining the RGB values between 0.3 and 0.8. This function is particularly useful in teaching fractions, as it visually represents the concept of equal and unequal parts.",
