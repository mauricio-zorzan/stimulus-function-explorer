    "description": "The function 'draw_stats_scatterplot' can draw a scatterplot of data points and a line of best fit. It accepts input of type 'StatsScatterplot', which includes a list of points and a line of best fit. Each point is defined by its x and y coordinates, while the line of best fit is defined by its slope and intercept. The function validates that all points are unique and within a specified range, and that the provided line of best fit closely matches the actual one. This visualization serves to illustrate the concept of statistical correlation and regression analysis, making it a valuable tool in the field of data science education.",
