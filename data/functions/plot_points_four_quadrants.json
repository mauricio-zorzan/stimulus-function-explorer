    "description": "The function 'plot_points_four_quadrants' is capable of creating scatter plots in a four-quadrant coordinate plane. It accepts a list of points as input, each point being an object with properties for its x and y coordinates, and a label. The function plots these points on the coordinate plane, labels them, and saves the resulting image to a specified location. The primary educational purpose of this function is to assist in teaching the concept of the Cartesian coordinate system, specifically the plotting of points in different quadrants. It can be used in a variety of educational scenarios, such as demonstrating the concept of negative coordinates, or visualizing solutions to equations.",
