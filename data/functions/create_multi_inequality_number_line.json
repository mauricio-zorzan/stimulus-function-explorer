It accepts a 'MultiInequalityNumberLine' object as input, which contains exactly 4 'InequalityNumberLine' objects. Each 'InequalityNumberLine' object represents a single inequality on a number line, including the range of the number line and the inequality to be displayed. The function validates the input to ensure that there are exactly 4 'InequalityNumberLine' objects.
