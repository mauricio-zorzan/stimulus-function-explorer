    "description": "The images generated by this function represent numbers using base ten blocks, with different types of blocks representing hundreds, tens, and ones. This visual representation helps students understand the concept of place value, which is fundamental to arithmetic. The blocks are drawn in a 3D perspective, which not only makes the images more visually appealing, but also introduces students to the concept of three-dimensional shapes. The color of the blocks is randomly generated each time the function is run, which adds an element of surprise and helps keep students engaged.",

    "educational_purpose": "By visualizing numbers as collections of base ten blocks, students can develop a more intuitive understanding of place value and how different digits contribute to the overall value of a number. This can help them perform arithmetic operations more confidently and accurately. The 3D perspective of the blocks also introduces students to the concept of three-dimensional shapes, which is a key part of the elementary mathematics curriculum."
