  "function_name": "draw_base_ten_blocks_division",
  "description": "This function generates a visual representation of the division process using base ten blocks. It takes a dividend and a divisor as input, breaks down the dividend into hundreds, tens, and ones, and then distributes these blocks across groups according to the divisor. This visualization helps students understand the concept of division as a process of equal distribution.",

    "description": "This function can generate a visualization of division using base ten blocks. It accepts two inputs: a dividend and a divisor, both of which are integers. The dividend is broken down into hundreds, tens, and ones, and these blocks are then distributed across groups according to the divisor. The visualization is designed to help students understand the concept of division as a process of equal distribution. The function has been designed with a focus on simplicity and clarity, making it suitable for use in educational settings.",
