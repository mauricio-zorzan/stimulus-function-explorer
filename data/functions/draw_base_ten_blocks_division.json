    "title": "Available Images: Division with Base Ten Blocks",
    "description": "The images generated by this function represent division problems using base ten blocks, a common tool used in elementary math education. The blocks are drawn in a 3D perspective and are color-coded to represent hundreds, tens, and ones. The blocks are arranged in a way that visually demonstrates the division process. For example, if the division problem is 300 divided by 5, the function would draw 300 as three hundred-blocks and then visually divide these blocks into five equal groups. This visual representation helps students understand the concept of division as 'grouping' or 'partitioning'.",

    "educational_purpose": "By visualizing division problems with base ten blocks, students can better understand the concept of division as 'grouping' or 'partitioning'. This tangible, visual approach can help students grasp abstract mathematical concepts more easily. Moreover, the color-coding of the blocks allows students to see the different values (hundreds, tens, ones) involved in the division process, reinforcing their understanding of the base ten system."
