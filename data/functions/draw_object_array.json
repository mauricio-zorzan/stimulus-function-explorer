    "description": "The 'draw_object_array' function creates a grid of images, where the image used and the size of the grid are defined by the user. The images can be any object, such as a sun, and the grid can be any size, defined by a specific number of rows and columns. This visualization tool is designed to help students understand and visualize mathematical concepts such as counting and multiplication. For example, a grid of 3 rows and 4 columns of suns can help a student understand that 3 groups of 4 suns equals 12 suns in total.",

    "educational_purpose": "The 'draw_object_array' function aids in the visualization and understanding of mathematical concepts such as counting and multiplication. By visualizing these concepts in a concrete way, students can better grasp the meaning and application of these concepts. For example, a student may understand that 3 groups of 4 equals 12, but visualizing this concept with a grid of images can help solidify this understanding. Furthermore, this function can be used to introduce the concept of arrays, which is a fundamental concept in more advanced mathematics and computer science."
