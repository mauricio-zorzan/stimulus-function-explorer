    "description": "The 'create_probability_diagram' function generates a table-based probability diagram. It accepts input in the form of a ProbabilityDiagram object, which includes row and column titles, and data. The data should be a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row in the table. The keys of the dictionary should match the column titles. The function does not have explicit constraints or validation rules, but the data should be formatted correctly to avoid errors. The educational purpose of this function is to help students visualize probability distributions and understand the concept of probability in a more tangible way.",
