The ray's angle is adjustable, and the function checks for intersections between the ray and the triangle's sides. This can be used for educational purposes such as teaching geometry, angle measurement, and the concept of rays.",

It accepts a RightTriangleWithRay object as input, which contains the triangle's points, angles, and rays. The function identifies the right angle vertex and plots the triangle and ray accordingly. The ray's angle is adjustable, and the function checks for intersections between the ray and the triangle's sides.
