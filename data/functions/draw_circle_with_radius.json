    "description": "The 'draw_circle_with_radius' function is capable of generating images of circles with a specific radius. The function accepts a single input parameter, 'data', which is an instance of the 'Circle' class. This class should contain the radius of the circle to be drawn. The function does not have any constraints or limits on the radius value. It is primarily used in educational contexts, to help students visualize the concept of radius in a circle and understand how changing the radius affects the size of the circle.",
