    "description": "The function 'create_multi_labeled_unit_fraction_number_line' can draw multiple unit fraction number lines, each labeled with fractions. It accepts inputs based on the stimulus description class, which includes the number of lines, the range of each line, and the number of minor divisions. The function validates these inputs, ensuring that the range minimum is 0 and the range maximum is the fraction value. It is particularly useful in educational settings where students are learning about fractions and their representation on number lines.",
