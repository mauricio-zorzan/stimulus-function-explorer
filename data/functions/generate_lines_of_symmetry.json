    "description": "The function can draw a variety of shapes based on the provided coordinates and illustrate their lines of symmetry. The input is an instance of the 'LinesOfSymmetry' class, which includes the coordinates of the shape's vertices and the lines of symmetry. Each line of symmetry is defined by its slope and intercept. The function cycles through a list of colors to distinguish between different lines of symmetry. The output is a plot with the shape and its lines of symmetry, with a legend indicating which line corresponds to which color. This function is particularly useful in teaching geometry, specifically in demonstrating and exploring the concept of symmetry.",
