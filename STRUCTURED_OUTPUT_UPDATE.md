# Structured Output Update - Summary

## ✅ Successfully Updated!

The AI image search has been upgraded to use OpenAI's **structured output** feature with JSON schema validation. This is a significant improvement over the previous approach.

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before (Text-based prompts)

- AI generated free-form text responses
- Manual JSON parsing with fallback error handling
- No guarantee of valid JSON
- Required try/catch blocks for parsing failures

### After (Structured Output with Schema)

- **Guaranteed valid JSON** conforming to schema
- Single API call with image + function catalog
- Automatic validation by OpenAI
- More reliable and predictable responses

## 🚀 Key Improvements

### 1. JSON Schema Validation

```python
schema = {
    "name": "StimulusFunctionMatches",
    "strict": True,
    "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "ranked": {
                "type": "array",
                "items": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "required": ["name", "score", "reasons"],
                    "properties": {
                        "name": {"type": "string"},
                        "score": {"type": "number"},
                        "reasons": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}
                    }
                }
            },
            "functions": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}
        },
        "required": ["ranked", "functions"]
    }
}
```

### 2. Combined Image + Catalog Analysis

- Single API call instead of multiple
- AI sees both image AND function catalog together
- More context = better matching

### 3. Detailed Scoring with Reasons

Each match now includes:

- `function_name`: The matched function
- `similarity_score`: Visual similarity (0-100)
- `ai_score`: Semantic/catalog matching score
- `ai_reasons`: Array of why it matched (e.g., "Tags include base_ten_blocks", "Visual structure matches")
- `reasoning`: Explanation of visual similarity

### 4. Anti-Confusion Rules Enforced

The prompt explicitly includes penalties for common confusion:

- Image has base-ten blocks but function is fraction model: **-4 points**
- Image has fraction partitions but function is base-ten: **-4 points**
- 2D vs 3D mismatch: **-2 points**
- Graph vs geometric shape mismatch: **-3 points**

## 📊 Test Results

Using a base-ten blocks image, the system correctly identified:

1. **draw_base_ten_blocks** (70% similarity, AI score: 10)

   - Reasons: "Exact match with base ten blocks", "Visual structure alignment with flats and rods"

2. **draw_base_ten_blocks_division** (60% similarity, AI score: 6)

   - Reasons: "Tags include base ten blocks and division"

3. **draw_base_ten_blocks_grid** (60% similarity, AI score: 6)
   - Reasons: "Visual structure aligns with grid representation"

✅ **No false positives** - didn't confuse with fraction models or unrelated functions!

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Files Modified

- `/src/ai_search.py` - Updated `search_by_image()` method
  - Now uses `response_format={"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": schema}`
  - Combines image encoding with catalog in single API call
  - Returns structured data with scores and reasons

### API Usage

- Model: `gpt-4o-mini` (supports vision + structured output)
- Temperature: 0 (deterministic)
- Max tokens: 1000
- Response format: JSON schema (guaranteed valid)

### Backward Compatibility

The response still includes:

- `functions`: Simple array of function names (for backward compatibility)
- `ranked`: Detailed array with scores and reasons (new feature)

## 💰 Cost Impact

**Slightly higher per search** but more efficient:

- Before: Multiple API calls (analyze → search → compare multiple)
- After: Single API call (analyze + match) → compare top candidates

Estimated: **$0.02-$0.06 per search** (was $0.01-$0.05)

- Benefit: Better accuracy, guaranteed valid responses

## 🎓 Synonym Mapping

The system normalizes these terms:

- Base ten blocks ≈ place value blocks, Dienes blocks, flats/rods/units
- Flat ≈ hundreds square, 10×10 grid
- Rod/Long ≈ tens bar, 1×10 bar
- Unit/Cube ≈ ones square, 1×1
- Fraction models ≈ fraction bars, area models, partitioned rectangles
- Number line ≈ line with ticks/intervals
- Graph ≈ chart, plot, visualization
- Coordinate plane ≈ xy-axis, Cartesian plane

## 📝 Scoring System

### Exact Matches

- Function name/tags contain key terms: **+4**
- Description contains key terms: **+3**
- Category contains key terms: **+2**

### Visual Structure Alignment

- 10×10 grid + 1×10 bars + 1×1 units: **+4**
- Fraction partitions with part/whole emphasis: **+3**
- Coordinate plane with plotted elements: **+4**
- Number line with ticks: **+3**

### Anti-Confusion Penalties

- Base-ten vs fraction mismatch: **-4**
- 2D vs 3D mismatch: **-2**
- Graph vs geometric shape mismatch: **-3**

### Results

- Returns top 8 functions with score > 0
- If none score > 0, returns top 3 by semantic similarity

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
python test_structured_output.py
```

Expected output:

- ✓ Valid JSON with schema
- ✓ Scores and reasons for each match
- ✓ No false positives (anti-confusion working)
- ✓ Appropriate matches ranked by relevance

## 🚦 Next Steps

The updated code is ready to use! The Streamlit app (`app_new.py`) automatically uses the new method when users upload images.

To test in the UI:

1. Run `streamlit run app_new.py`
2. Go to "🤖 AI-powered Search"
3. Select "🖼️ Image Upload"
4. Upload a base-ten blocks, fraction, or graph image
5. See the improved matching with scores and reasons!
